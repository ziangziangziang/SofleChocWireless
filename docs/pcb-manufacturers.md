# PCB Manufacturers

I will ask PCB manufacturers to make PCBs for me. I consider the following factors when choosing a PCB manufacturer:
1. **Price**: I wish to spend minimal money on the PCBs.
1. **Ease of order**: I like to order online without any human interaction. I also wish to get a quote immediately.
2. **Quantity**: I wish to order a small quantity of PCBs. For example, 6 pieces for 3 keyboards.
3. **Intro Bonus**: I wish to get a discount for the first order.

## Specifications
The board should be at least 1.6 mm thick. 
- Layers：2 Layers; 
- Size: 111.8 × 143.4 mm; （4.40 × 5.65 inches）
